# Decoding Devops

This repository is created and maitained by me as I want to document my journey of learning about DevOps and various tools and technologies around it.

This will **not cover all things** "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.

I have taken isnspiration from [Michael Cade](https://github.com/MichaelCade) from his project [90 Days of DevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps)

You can also take reference from [Imran Teli's course on DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/decodingdevops)
