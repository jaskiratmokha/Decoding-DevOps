# Amazon CloudFront

## Overview
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.

## Key Features
- **Global Content Delivery**: CloudFront uses a network of edge locations strategically located around the world to deliver content to users with minimal latency.
  
- **Security**: CloudFront integrates with other AWS services like AWS Shield and AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide robust DDoS protection and application security.

- **Content Caching**: CloudFront caches frequently accessed content at edge locations, reducing the load on origin servers and improving overall performance.

- **Customization**: CloudFront allows customization of content delivery through features like Lambda@Edge, which enables running serverless code at edge locations.

- **SSL/TLS**: CloudFront supports SSL/TLS encryption to ensure secure data transfer between viewers and origin servers.

## CloudFront with S3
- CloudFront can be used with Amazon S3 as the origin server, enabling fast and scalable delivery of static and dynamic content stored in S3 buckets.

## CloudFront with ALB as Origin
- CloudFront can also use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) as the origin server, allowing dynamic content generated by web applications hosted on EC2 instances or containers to be delivered globally with low latency.

## CloudFront Geo Restriction
- CloudFront offers geo restriction capabilities, allowing users to restrict access to content based on geographic locations, such as countries or continents.

## CloudFront Price Classes
- CloudFront offers different price classes that determine the edge locations used for content delivery. Users can choose between price classes based on their performance and cost requirements.

## CloudFront Cache Invalidation
- CloudFront supports cache invalidation, allowing users to remove outdated or stale content from CloudFront edge caches and ensure that viewers receive the most up-to-date content.

## Pricing
- **Pay-as-you-go**: CloudFront follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where users only pay for the data transfer and requests they use, with no upfront fees or long-term contracts.

- **Pricing Factors**: Pricing factors include data transfer out, HTTP/HTTPS requests, invalidation requests, and additional features like Lambda@Edge.

## Use Cases
- **Static and Dynamic Content Delivery**: CloudFront is suitable for delivering both static and dynamic content, including websites, APIs, streaming media, and IoT data.

- **Global Websites**: CloudFront accelerates the delivery of websites to users worldwide, improving performance and user experience.

- **Streaming Media**: CloudFront supports the delivery of streaming media, including on-demand and live streaming, with low latency and high reliability.

- **Security and Compliance**: CloudFront helps enforce security policies and compliance requirements by integrating with AWS security services and providing features like signed URLs and field-level encryption.
